In Greek Mythology, Oceanus was the Titan God of the Ocean, one with the ability to fluidly navigate across tides. We at Oceanus desire to provide an interface run on the Meta x Ray-Bans glasses to provide spatial navigation to those with visual impairments and/or Alzheimers.Through YOLO and OpenCV (Hugging Face Visual Transformer) we identify the closest object of that type, and enclose it with a bounding box. Then, we utilize two zero-shot learning models (depth anything and SAM) and a novel mathematical path-finding algorithm we developed to provide audio cues to the user moving through legal motion (paths without obstacles in the way aligned toward the target object/location using surround sound spatial audio). With this interface running on the Meta x Ray Bans glasses, we also have developed a memory collection software that captures the last relevant locations that key items were placed by an individual (we use a multi-modal model to help individuals navigate back to where they left these items).
